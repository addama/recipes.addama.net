- 1-2 tbs red wine vinegar
- Spices and/or herb bundles as desired

## Preparation

- Save edible vegetable scraps in a freezer bag to supplement (but not replace) the vegetable components 
- Quarter the onion and potato(s), and slice the carrot and celery into 1-2 inch sections
- If using a whole head of garlic, slice in half horizontally
- If using individual garlic cloves, peel and lightly smash
- If not using pre-cooked chicken: season, roast, and debone chicken to your liking, ensuring that the chicken has had time to cool before deboning, and that similar seasoning is used in the rub as is used in the broth
- Debone the chicken, saving the carcass, skin, and drippings for the broth

## Instructions

1. Place all ingredients in stock pot in order of size, largest to smallest
1. Fill stock pot with water, up to just below the bolts of the handles
1. Bring to a light boil, then immediately reduce to a simmer
1. Simmer for 4-8 hours, stirring and refilling water every 30-60 minutes
1. After 50-60% of simmering time, taste, then add small amounts of salt as desired
1. After 80-90% of simmering time, determine how much liquid or concentration-level is desired, and either stop/limit refilling water, or continue as before
1. Before removing from heat, taste the broth for flavor, and adjust as necessary
1. Remove from heat, strain broth into second stock pot or jars, ensuring all solids are excluded and all liquid is drained as well as possible
1. Immediately place in glass jars for storage, or portion out for use

## Notes

Rosemary and garlic are a go-to flavor profile, and is especially flavorful if both the chicken and the broth are flavored this way. Limit extreme flavors like spicy pepper powder/seeds, sweet spices or vegetables, and bitter vegetables or vegetable parts like cucumbers or broccoli. While you should experiment with your flavor profile, be aware of strong flavors that will unbalance or replace others, making the broth less satisfying and complex.

Save edible vegetable scraps in a freezer bag to supplement (but not replace) the vegetable components. Onion and garlic skin, carrot peels, potato eyes are acceptable. Similarly, leftover stock or broth can be added in place of water.

If the chicken came with gizzards or offal, these should be used in the stock to add more flavor complexity and low notes. Collagen and other necessary nutrients by including chicken's feet, declawed.
