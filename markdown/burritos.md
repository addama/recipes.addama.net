## Notes

These are quick, cheap, Americanized burritos that serve as a platform for many ingredients and configurations, and should not be equated with traditional Mexican burritos.

For cleanup: combine ground beef and onions into the refried beans container, and mix. This should make 1-2 more burritos. Store all other ingredients in separate containers. Wash the pan, spatula, and silverware as soon as possible.
