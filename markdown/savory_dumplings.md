## Notes

This recipe is from the Chicken Fricot recipe in the book The Chicken Soup Manifesto, where it is a component in a larger recipe, but is applicable to any soup.

The original recipe calls for _savory_, which is an herb not readily available everywhere. A good alternative is thyme, sage, or a mixture of the two.
