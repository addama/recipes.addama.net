## Notes

This recipe was transcribed and interpreted from an index card recipe. Although labeled as barbeque, this recipe is for a Sloppy Joe-type mixture. The recipe mentions a sauce that might be "uao", "woo", or "wor" - I take this to be a shortening of Worchestershire sauce, which is understandably hard to spell.
