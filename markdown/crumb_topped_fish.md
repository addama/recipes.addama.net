## Notes

This recipe was transcribed and interpreted from an index card recipe. This recipe is light on the details (it doesn't even mention the fish...) so I am interpreting the recipe as if the execution is obvious. I pulled an appropriate oven temperature, but I suspect this might be too low based on the given cook time. This may or may not be accurate to the original intent.
