## Notes

This recipe was transcribed and interpreted from an index card recipe. The unit for "salad oil" is a combination of 2 symbols I don't recognize (looks like [jl, +l, +i, ji, tl, ti], where the first character is slightly above the second), but common sense indicates that 2 tablespoons of oil is sufficient to brown a steak in a pan, so that is the unit I will go with.
