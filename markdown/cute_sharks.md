## Notes

Seasonal fruit can be any fruit that is readily available and in-season, such as apple, strawberry, blackberry, blueberry, watermelon (in small cubes), etc. If the cucumber and bell pepper are particularly large, you may wish to omit the fruit, because the meal might be too large otherwise.

Choose cheeses and meats that have strong and varied flavors - don't be afraid to experiment or splurge on an expensive variety, because the rest of the meal is very inexpensive. Avoid high-fat meats that will unbalance the meal and give unpleasant side-effects.

Arrange components aesthetically on each plate, separating vegetables and ranch dressing from cheese, meat, fruit, and those from the bread.
