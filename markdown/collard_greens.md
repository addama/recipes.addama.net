## Ingredients

- 1 tbs olive oil
- 1/2 white onion
- 3-4 cloves garlic
- 2 cups beef broth, or vegetable broth if vegan, enough to cover at least half the chopped greens
- 2 bundles of cooking greens

## Equipment

- Stock pot or dutch oven, with lid
- Collander

## Preparation

- Thoroughly wash greens, then slice out the stem and any large veins, leaving only the leaf
- Cut the greens into strips or squares

## Instructions

1. Saute onion in olive oil on medium-high heat until softened
1. Add garlic, saute until fragrant, stirring frequently
1. Add greens and stock, then stir to incorporate
1. Bring to a simmer, cover, then cook for 10-15 minutes on medium-low heat
1. Stir occasionally to check doneness
1. Remove from heat, then drain the broth for use later, squeezing out as much liquid as possible without damaging the greens

## Notes

The broth, once it's had the greens cooked in it, has a wonderful and complex flavor that is great for a sipping broth, or a component in a soup.
