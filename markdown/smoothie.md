## Notes

This recipe was transcribed and interpreted from an index card recipe. This isn't so much a recipe as a list of ingredients that taste good in a smoothie, so I am extrapolating the actual instructions and preparation. The recipe mentions "5-2000" and "More kee" tofu, neither of which I understand. Based on some searching, I have to assume "More kee" is just a misspelling of a brand of Thai-style tofu, or referring specifically to Morinaga Mori-nu tofu, though I can't confirm if that brand existed at the time this recipe was written.
