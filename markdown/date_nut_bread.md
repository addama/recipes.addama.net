## Notes

This recipe was originally written on 3 very small and narrow slips of paper, and obviously represented several attempts at perfecting the recipe. Based on the differences and the vagueness about a few ingredients (candied cherries), I have to assume that either the completed recipe exists elsewhere, or no final judgment was made. I have reproduced the text of all three documents below as best as I could, with no commentary or editing aside from <code>(?)</code> if I couldn't decipher a word.
