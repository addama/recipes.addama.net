## Notes

This recipe was transcribed and interpreted from an index card recipe. The measurement for brown sugar looks like "eu" but I'm interpreting it as an abbreviation for "cup" given the volume of the other ingredients listed. "1 bottle" and "1 eu" are written in pencil after the fact. The original contents of the document are below:
