## Notes

This recipe was transcribed and interpreted from an index card recipe. The original recipe was edited in pencil, making the following changes:

- "ko" or "no" was added after flour
- "1 Bay leaf" was added to the recipe
- The amount of bouillon was increased from 1 to 2 teaspoons

For the purposes of this interpretation, I will opt to use the amended recipe as the intent of the edits was to add flavor, although the addition of more bouillon may produce a more salty result.
